            the private key for signing app updates which will be distributed via Sparkle.
            This key will be associated with your user account.
            
            Note: You only need one signing key, no matter how many apps you embed Sparkle in.
            
            The keychain may ask permission for this tool to access an existing key, if one
            exists, or for permission to save the new key. You must allow access in order to
            successfully proceed.

            Additional Options:
            -p
                Looks up and just prints the existing public key stored in the Keychain.

            -x private-key-file
                Exports your private key from your login keychain and writes it to private-key-file. Note the contents of
                this sensitive exported file are the same as the password to the \"\(PRIVATE_KEY_LABEL)\" item in
                your keychain.
            
            -f private-key-file
                Imports the private key from private-key-file into your keychain instead of generating a new key.
                This file has likely been exported via -x option from another machine.
                Any existing \"\(PRIVATE_KEY_LABEL)\" items listed in Keychain Access may need to be removed manually first before proceeding.
