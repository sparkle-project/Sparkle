/*
 Modern container format for binary delta archives.
 
 Delta archive format has four sections which are the header, the relative file path table, the commands, and the data blobs.
 
 The relative file path table records all the file paths the archive needs to know about.
 The commands are the operations to be recorded (eg: extract, clone, binary diff, delete).
 The commands may additionally have more metadata such as file permission modes, relative path indexes in the case of clones, or file sizes for the data blobs.
 The data blobs contain all file data from extract and binary diff outputs.
 
 The implementation design of this archive is such that we do not seek backwards or skip ahead to fetch data.
 We go through the archive when writing or reading from it in a single pass.

    (M commands where M <= N paths)
    (Indexes for commands refer to indexes to relative file path table, excluding extraneous trailing entries in relative path table used for clones)
    (Last command denotes a null end marker)
 
 [ DATA BLOBS ]
 All raw binary data joined together
 (P number of blobs where P <= M commands)
 (Indexes for data blobs refer to indexes for a filtered list of applicable commands that have data content)
